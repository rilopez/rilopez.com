      <description>Too often, succesfull people can&amp;rsquo;t tell the difference between wanting to win and wanting to win too much. The first part can be a good motivator but the secon is a problem.
 It was an interesting read, it make me realized the effect we have on people could bad if we focused on ourselves. It is important Listen and don&amp;rsquo;t try to add something to what other people say, just appreciate, say thanks and help if they ask, you are not a superman as you think you are, it is important to let them growth.</description>

      <description>I just discovered Marshall Goldsmith and he is awesome, looking forward to read his book What got you here, won&amp;rsquo;t get you there. Here are my takeaways:
 We spend a lot of time helping leaders learn what to do, we don&amp;rsquo;t spend enough time helping leaders learn what to stop -Peter Drucker WINNING TO MUCH, we are so competitive that we argue who is more miserable &amp;ldquo;help more, judge less&amp;rdquo; Use little amounts of money to produce change in behavior We only can change what we want to change.</description>
