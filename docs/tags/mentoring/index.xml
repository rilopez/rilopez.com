      <description>The saying &amp;ldquo;when the student is ready, the teacher appears; when the student is truly ready, the teacher disappears&amp;rdquo; has been a guiding principle in my journey of continuous learning. In this post, I reflect on the mentors who have shaped my path at critical moments.
Multiple times in my life I got the opportunity to find good teachers,
When I needed to learn what a body can do, I found a lima-lama teacher in my neighborhood When I needed to learn music, I found DiosdadoFuentes and AaronJimenez When I needed to learn what a professional really is, I found VicenteRomero When I needed to learn how to lead, I found HumbertoCurmina When I needed to learn what team really is, I found RobertoMartinez When I needed to learn life I found my daughters Although I have lost contact with some of my teachers and mentors, their teachings remain with me.</description>
