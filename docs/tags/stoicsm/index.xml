      <description>Philosophy is not a trick to catch the public; it is not devised for show. it is non concerned with words, but with facts. It&amp;rsquo;s not employed for some pleasure before day is spent, or to relieve the uneasiness of our leisure. It shape and built up the soul, it gives order to live guides action, shows what should and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be done. &amp;ndash; it sits at the rudder steering our course as we vacillate in uncertanties.</description>
