      <description>Arthur C. Clarke&amp;rsquo;s novel, published in 1973, unfolds in the year 2131, when humanity detects an object, initially thought to be a cylindrical asteroid, in the outer solar system, beyond the orbit of Jupiter. Named Rama, this object piques human curiosity, leading to the dispatch of the spaceship Endeavour to investigate.
Upon arrival, the crew discovers that Rama is not an asteroid but a hollow, artificial structure, containing an entire ecosystem and deserted cities within its vast cylindrical interior.</description>
