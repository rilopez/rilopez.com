      <description>this is my go to reference book for any software engineering work/life problem. it contains a lot of wisdom gathered from the tranches of multiple software projects
Some tips/phrases I remember the most:
Mob programming: when more than two programmers work in the same code, same time. Take responsibility, provide options , Don&amp;rsquo;t make lame excuses Stone soup and boiled frogs Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio Good design is easier to change than bad design Orthogonality: in geometry two lines are orthogonal if they meet at right angles.</description>
