      <description>One of the first movies that I watch in a beta video format was Terminator, I remember going to my friends house, it was amazing, a very real Robot killing everyone was very memorable for my young mind. One of the scenes I remember the most was when the terminator steals a car, Arnold describes that that scene was filmed without city permission and very quick.
Arnold have had an exceptional life, one of the anecdotes I liked the most was after being questioned about a hidden message (I, F, Y) to lawmakers, and that it could not be a coincidence because the chance of that happened by coincide was very low, Arnold answered by asking</description>

      <description>Any Walter Isaacson&amp;rsquo;s biography is a warranty of delivering a bio research with story-telling structure and, This book was not the exception.
Although a lot has been writing about Leonardo Da Vinci, I was only familiar with his amazing notebooks and his famous paintings, but little I new about other important parts of this life like:
 Niccol√≤ Machiavelli was his close friend.

      <description>Nearsoft Academy: Lessons learned after almost a decade preparing interns With a tight talent market, developing talent in-house gets a special appeal. Not only because of the reduction of costs but for the opportunity to rise the bar for future generations. Some assumptions anybody makes when trying to implement an internship program are,
 We can ask our seniors to mentor interns We are better at teaching than their university professors With the right training program any college graduate can produce good work at our organization  After almost a decade of working with interns, at Nearsoft academy We learned a lot of hard lessons that help us to get rid of those assumptions</description>

      <description>Where my money went this time? That is always my question every time I take a look to my monthly bank statements. Over the years I have tried several apps and methods to reduce the panic we get when we have no idea how we acquired that credit card debt, Although all the options have its pros &amp;amp; cons, commonly they share the same problem of locking your data to their chooses proprietary format, giving you the risk of not being able to read when the online service disappears or the app no longer run on newer OS or devises.</description>

      <description>8 years ago I started the foundations of our internship program at nearsoft, called Nearsoft Academy. So far 91 young engineers have taken the program, most of them worked for us right after graduation.
Designing an internship program Because I think that a software engineer is most about people than about &amp;ldquo;techy stuff&amp;rdquo;, I tried to design the program following the teachings several books like fearless change, pragmatic programmer, outliers &amp;amp; code complete</description>

      <title>Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning</title>

      <description>Some random general highlights
 The most important is to fight forgetfulness. Learning styles is a myth, there are preferences but there is not true that some people learn better with a given kind of material (listening, reading, etc) Recalling and reflection is better than massive practice, the later gives the illusion of knowing by familiarizing the student with the material but the forgetfulness is quicker  Learning is misunderstood when we ask people about the best(preferred) learning method, most people will answer that it would be re-reading and highlight the material, but this approach is not backed up by data.</description>

      <description>Some random hightlights   Anything can be learned with a good designed deliverate practice
  the 10,000 hours myth (popularized by Malcom Gladwell) has been doing more harm than good, because it is not the time you put into something but how &amp;amp; what you practice
  deliberate practice is how anything can be learn. the components of a deliberate practice are:
 A well defined practice plan, with small steps or goals Proper Feedback (in a timely manner) Monitor your progress Mantain motivation Full Attention Mental Models should be considered    </description>

      <description>Per Dayra Chiu recommendation , last year I read the book Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise by by K. Anders Ericsson &amp;amp; Robert Pool. I didn&amp;rsquo;t imagine how much gold I would find in that book. the topic that surprised the most was: Deliberate practices
First, what is deliberate practice? Is a special type of practice that is purposeful and systematic. It is highly demanding mentally so it requires high levels of focus and concentration.</description>

      <guid>https://rilopez.com/posts/impediment-to-action-advances-action/</guid>
      <description>While it is true that someone can impede our actions, they can not impede our intentions and our attitudes, which have the power of being conditional and adaptable. For the Mind converts any obstacle to its action into means of achieving it. That which is an impediment to action advances action , What stands in the way becomes the way

      <description>Philosophy is not a trick to catch the public; it is not devised for show. it is non concerned with words, but with facts. It&amp;rsquo;s not employed for some pleasure before day is spent, or to relieve the uneasiness of our leisure. It shape and built up the soul, it gives order to live guides action, shows what should and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be done. &amp;ndash; it sits at the rudder steering our course as we vacillate in uncertanties.</description>

      <description>You have endured countless troubles &amp;ndash; all for not letting your ruling reason do the work it was made for&amp;ndash; Enough already &amp;mdash; Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.26
 In Spanish there is this saying &amp;ldquo;toma al toro por los cuernos&amp;rdquo; to indicate to take charge of the problem/issue/task in front. In this quote Marcus indicate that we should do it always using our ruling reason.</description>

      <description>I read the book fearless change almost 8 years ago and since then I have been a big follower of Linda Rising teachings. Because one of my new-year resolutions was to meet at least one of my heros, I asked Carlos (from dojo live) to help me talk to Linda Rising, I was not hoping he could get her as a guess in dojo live,.. ohh I was very very wrong.</description>

      <description>I have always thought that the best motivator to learn something is when somebody pays you for doing it (indirectly). Last year I accepted a small freelance project just because it would be a good oportinity to sharp skills and add something new to my bag of tricks. Since for sometime I have been using some &amp;ldquo;outdated&amp;rdquo; things (Ember.js, ColdFusion, Node.js , YUI Library), so I thought &amp;ldquo;it would be cool to use something &amp;ldquo;mainstream/popular&amp;rdquo; with younger developers, and I got surprised because I found something that had all of that and it was a cool name: JHipster</description>

      <description>Too often, succesfull people can&amp;rsquo;t tell the difference between wanting to win and wanting to win too much. The first part can be a good motivator but the secon is a problem.
 It was an interesting read, it make me realized the effect we have on people could bad if we focused on ourselves. It is important Listen and don&amp;rsquo;t try to add something to what other people say, just appreciate, say thanks and help if they ask, you are not a superman as you think you are, it is important to let them growth.</description>

      <description>I just discovered Marshall Goldsmith and he is awesome, looking forward to read his book What got you here, won&amp;rsquo;t get you there. Here are my takeaways:
 We spend a lot of time helping leaders learn what to do, we don&amp;rsquo;t spend enough time helping leaders learn what to stop -Peter Drucker WINNING TO MUCH, we are so competitive that we argue who is more miserable &amp;ldquo;help more, judge less&amp;rdquo; Use little amounts of money to produce change in behavior We only can change what we want to change.</description>

      <description>This book resonated a lot with me. Suddenly I realized that there is a way to introduce changes in any human organization. I have been working on government systems for 2 years and started to see a now way out. I am looking forward to put in practice the patterns.
Here some patterns that I found interesting:
 Just Do It: Don‚Äôt wait for the perfect moment when you have the resources and knowledge you think you need; instead, take the first baby step and start learning.</description>

      <description>this is my go to reference book for any software engineering work/life problem. it contains a lot of wisdom gathered from the tranches of multiple software projects
Some tips/phrases I remember the most:
 Mob programming: when more than two programmers work in the same code, same time. Take responsibility, provide options , Don&amp;rsquo;t make lame excuses Stone soup and boiled frogs Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio Good design is easier to change than bad design Orthogonality: in geometry two lines are orthogonal if they meet at right angles.</description>
