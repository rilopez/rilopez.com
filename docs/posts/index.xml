      <description>My takeaways  Neuralink had a great streaming showing their latest updates they showed live telemetry directly from an alive walking pig Pigs are similar to people, they move a lot and they are robust so if the device does not get malfunctions on pigs , it would work on people Currently the team is 100 people, it is expected to grow up to 10K people the device uses something like bluetooth Clinical trial is aimed at people with paraplegia In the future you can record your memories and play it back, How do we know that this moment is not our future self playing back his memories?</description>

      <description>Nearsoft Academy: Lessons learned after almost a decade preparing interns With a tight talent market, developing talent in-house gets a special appeal. Not only because of the reduction of costs but for the opportunity to rise the bar for future generations. Some assumptions anybody makes when trying to implement an internship program are,
 We can ask our seniors to mentor interns We are better at teaching than their university professors With the right training program any college graduate can produce good work at our organization  After almost a decade of working with interns, at Nearsoft academy We learned a lot of hard lessons that help us to get rid of those assumptions</description>

      <description>Where my money went this time? That is always my question every time I take a look to my monthly bank statements. Over the years I have tried several apps and methods to reduce the panic we get when we have no idea how we acquired that credit card debt, Although all the options have its pros &amp;amp; cons, commonly they share the same problem of locking your data to their chooses proprietary format, giving you the risk of not being able to read when the online service disappears or the app no longer run on newer OS or devises.</description>

      <description>8 years ago I started the foundations of our internship program at nearsoft, called Nearsoft Academy. So far 91 young engineers have taken the program, most of them worked for us right after graduation.
Designing an internship program Because I think that a software engineer is most about people than about &amp;ldquo;techy stuff&amp;rdquo;, I tried to design the program following the teachings several books like fearless change, pragmatic programmer, outliers &amp;amp; code complete</description>

      <description>Per Dayra Chiu recommendation , last year I read the book Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise by by K. Anders Ericsson &amp;amp; Robert Pool. I didn&amp;rsquo;t imagine how much gold I would find in that book. the topic that surprised the most was: Deliberate practices
First, what is deliberate practice? Is a special type of practice that is purposeful and systematic. It is highly demanding mentally so it requires high levels of focus and concentration.</description>

      <guid>https://rilopez.com/posts/impediment-to-action-advances-action/</guid>
      <description>While it is true that someone can impede our actions, they can not impede our intentions and our attitudes, which have the power of being conditional and adaptable. For the Mind converts any obstacle to its action into means of achieving it. That which is an impediment to action advances action , What stands in the way becomes the way
Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 5.20
 How many times we forget this?</description>

      <description>Philosophy is not a trick to catch the public; it is not devised for show. it is non concerned with words, but with facts. It&amp;rsquo;s not employed for some pleasure before day is spent, or to relieve the uneasiness of our leisure. It shape and built up the soul, it gives order to live guides action, shows what should and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be done. &amp;ndash; it sits at the rudder steering our course as we vacillate in uncertanties.</description>

      <description>You have endured countless troubles &amp;ndash; all for not letting your ruling reason do the work it was made for&amp;ndash; Enough already &amp;mdash; Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.26
 In Spanish there is this saying &amp;ldquo;toma al toro por los cuernos&amp;rdquo; to indicate to take charge of the problem/issue/task in front. In this quote Marcus indicate that we should do it always using our ruling reason.</description>

      <description>I read the book fearless change almost 8 years ago and since then I have been a big follower of Linda Rising teachings. Because one of my new-year resolutions was to meet at least one of my heros, I asked Carlos (from dojo live) to help me talk to Linda Rising, I was not hoping he could get her as a guess in dojo live,.. ohh I was very very wrong.</description>

      <description>I have always thought that the best motivator to learn something is when somebody pays you for doing it (indirectly). Last year I accepted a small freelance project just because it would be a good oportinity to sharp skills and add something new to my bag of tricks. Since for sometime I have been using some &amp;ldquo;outdated&amp;rdquo; things (Ember.js, ColdFusion, Node.js , YUI Library), so I thought &amp;ldquo;it would be cool to use something &amp;ldquo;mainstream/popular&amp;rdquo; with younger developers, and I got surprised because I found something that had all of that and it was a cool name: JHipster</description>

      <description>I just discovered Marshall Goldsmith and he is awesome, looking forward to read his book What got you here, won&amp;rsquo;t get you there. Here are my takeaways:
 We spend a lot of time helping leaders learn what to do, we don&amp;rsquo;t spend enough time helping leaders learn what to stop -Peter Drucker WINNING TO MUCH, we are so competitive that we argue who is more miserable &amp;ldquo;help more, judge less&amp;rdquo; Use little amounts of money to produce change in behavior We only can change what we want to change.</description>
