I just read the book [Idea Makers: Personal Perspectives on the lives Ideas 
of some notable People by Stephen Wolfram][1] and it is amazing. Here some of my takeaways


- [John von Newumann][2]: when John died He left his daughter a Box that should 
  be  opened on the 50th anniversary of his death, his Daughter emailed Stephen that 
  disappointingly the box was not John von Newman's at all!

- There is a lot much more about [Ada Lovelace][3], the first programmer. Although she
  was a tenacious, smart and hardworking woman,  His father was the poet Lord Byron 
  and Lady Byron(a Baroness), She met [Charles Babbage][4] at a facy party at his 
  house. She like mathematics and spend her time translating writings from other 
  mathematicians, She got interested in the Charles Babbage's mechanical calculator 
  and colaborated with Him on creating notes of charle's designs, this notes were 
  intented to add clarity  to use Charles Babdage's Machine. 

  Sadly Ada had health problems and died young, previously to her death, Ada & her 
  husband piched to Charles the idea of creating a company to complete his machine,
  He had governed founding, but because of the lack of results it was cut, Charles did
  not accepted.

- [Gottfried Leibniz][5] had also the idea of an universal calculator, in his papers are all
  sorts of diagrams about how the machine should work, the strange thing is that 
  eventhough He wrote about binary numbers, He based his design on base 10, instead of   the much simpler binary approach we use today. 

- [Salomon Golomb][6] most our modern communications uses Golomb's  
  [maximum-length linear-feedback shift register sequence][7], it is probably the most 
  used math algorithm in the world
