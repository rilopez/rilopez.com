This book resonated a lot with me. Suddenly I realized that there is  a way to introduce changes in any human organization.
I have been working on government systems for 2 years and started to see a now way out. I am looking forward to put in practice 
the patterns.

Here some patterns that I found interesting
* **Just Do It:** Don’t wait for the perfect moment when you have the resources and knowledge you think you need; instead, 
  take the first baby step and start learning.  
* **Do Food:** To influence attendees, bring special food to a meeting.
* **Know Yourself:** Before you begin, and throughout the long journey required to lead a change initiative, consider 
 whether you still have a real abiding passion and the talents and abilities to make it happen.
* **Emotional Connection:** Connection with the feelings of your audience is usually more effective in persuading 
  them than just presenting the facts 
* **Low Hanging Fruit:** To show progress in the change initiative, complete a quick and easy, low-risk task with wide impact and
  then publicize the results.
* **Myth buster:** Identify misconceptions surronding the change initiative and address them in a timely and forthright
  manner.
* **Pick your Battles:** Before you expend your energy in conflict, ask yourself whether you belive the issue is really 
  important and if you have the resources to carry your fight through to the end. 
* **Champion Skeptic:** Ask for help from opinion leaders who are skeptical of your new idea, and use their comments 
  to improve your effort, even if you don’t change their minds.   
* **Bridge Builder:** Ask those who have accepted the new idea to talk with those who have not.          
* **Elevator pitch** always have a couple of sentences on hand to introduce to others your new idea
*Brown Bag cofee
* **Shoulder to Cry On:** To avoid becoming too discouraged when the going gets tough, find opportunities for 
  everyone to have supportive listeners.
