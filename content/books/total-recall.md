One of the first movies that I watch in a beta video format was Terminator, I remember going to my
friends house, it was amazing, a very real Robot killing everyone was very memorable for my young
mind. One of  the scenes I remember the most was when the terminator steals a car,  Arnold describes
that that scene was filmed without city permission  and very quick. 


Arnold have had an exceptional life, one of the anecdotes I liked the most was after being
questioned about a hidden message (I, F, Y) to lawmakers, and that it could not be a coincidence
because the chance of that happened by coincide was very low, Arnold answered by asking

> What are the odds of a guy from Austria 
>  - Win multiple bodybuilding world contests 
>  - Get rich in real state
>  - Became highest payed Hollywood actor
>  - Marry a Kennedy 
>  - Became Governor of California 


My main take away of the book is hard work and a clear vision is everything in life.


## Arnold's Rules

1. Reps, Reps, Reps
2. Care for the body and the mind.
3. The Day Has 24 hours, Use Them All.
