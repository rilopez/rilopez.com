Any Walter Isaacson's biography is a warranty of delivering a bio research with story-telling structure
and, This book was not the exception. 

Although a lot has been writing about Leonardo Da Vinci, I was only familiar with his amazing
notebooks and his famous paintings, but little I new about other important parts of this life like:

 - Niccol√≤ Machiavelli was his close friend.
 - Closes a job request letter (to [Ludovico Sforza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_Sforza)) with something like ["By the Way I am also a painter"](https://www.reactivatejob.eu/leonardo_da_vinci-s_cover_letter_1)  
 - Was an eternal procastinator
 - His most important talent was his observation skills
