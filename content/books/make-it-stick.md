Some random general  highlights
 
  * The most important is to fight forgetfulness.
  * Learning styles is a myth, there are preferences but there is not true that some people learn better with 
    a given kind of material (listening, reading, etc)
  * Recalling and reflection is better than massive practice, the later gives the illusion of knowing by 
    familiarizing the student with the material but the forgetfulness  is quicker



## Learning is misunderstood
when we ask people about the best(preferred) learning method, most people will answer that it would be 
re-reading and highlight  the material, but this  approach is not backed up by data. 

The most effective strategies are often counter intuitive:

  * Retrieval practice 
  * Space out practice
  * Trying to solve a problem before being taught the solution

All new learning requires a foundation of prior learning. If you practice *Elaboration*, there's no known limit
to how much you can learn. **Elaboration** is the process of giving new material meaning by expression it in 
your own words and connecting with what you already know.

## To learn, retrieve
A central Challenge to improving the way we learn is finding a way to interrupt the process of forgetting. 
The testing effect is a term used by psychologist to refer the power observed of retrieval as a learning tool. 


Exams & Testing works, special when we provide feedback on wrong answers

## Mix Up your practice
Most people  think that people learn better through single-minded focus and dogged repetition, because these 
beliefs are validated time and again by visible improvements, but scientists have found that this is momentary.
The very techniques that build habit strength, like spacing, interleaving and variation, slow visible 
acquisition and fail to deliver improvement during practice that helps to motivate and reinforce our efforts 
how ever these techniques are what we need to really learn something 

## Embrace Difficulties
It's one thing to feel confident of your knowledge; it's something else to demonstrate mastery. 
Testing is not only a powerful learning strategy, it is a potent reality check on accuracy of you 
own judgment of what you know how to do. 

How learning occurs

 * **Encoding:** the brain  converts your  perceptions into meaningful representations in the brain.
 * **Consolidation:** The process of learning often starts out feeling disorganized and unwieldy; the brain 
     makes connections with prior knowledge by retrieving  a memory from long-term storage. This act both 
     strengthen the memory traces and at the same time make them modifiable again, enabling them, for example, 
     to connect to more recent learning.
  * **Retrieval:** the brain access memories by the "cues" or connections between memories. There is virtually 
     no limit to how much learning we can remember as long as we relate it to what we already know.

When we  make a concentrated effort to recall, the learning is made "editable" again,  and the consequent 
re-consolidation helps to reinforce meaning, strengthen connections to prior knowledge, bolster the cues and 
retrieval routes for recalling it later, and weaken competing routes

In every learning strategy we need to incorporate desirable difficulties, like trying to solve a problem before being show how to solve it.

## Avoid Illusions of knowing
On thinking fast and slow Daniel Kahneman indicates that  our mind has two modes of thinking : sytem
1 (Automatic and fast) & system 2 (rational and slow). Our system 1 can be easily hickyacked , and
giving us a false sense of knowing something, that's why we need to put conscious effort (system 2)
in validating our knowledge. It is common that people with less knowledge  overestimates it is own
abilities.  This problem was document in several studies, specially the Dunning-Kruger effect where
people belive that they are smarte and more capable than they really are.

Regarding tools or habits for calibrating our judgment it mentions: 
  
  * Make frequent use of testing and retrieval practice
  * Retrieval practice
  * Cumulative quizzing
  * Peer Instruction.

## Get beyond learning styles
The idea that individuals have distinct learning styles has been around long enough to become part
of the folklore, the "theory" holds that people who receive instruction in a manner that is not
matched to their learning style are at disadvantage for learning

The book makes it clear that everyone has learning preferences, but there is not evidence that
somebody learns better when the manner of instruction fits those preferences. However there are some
differences that seems to matter in how people learn:

 * How you see yourself and your abilities( see [Carol Dweck's book growth mindset](/books/growth-mindset.md))
 * Level of _language fluency and reading ability_ 
 * Structure building: the act, as we encounter new material, of extracting the salient ideas and
   constructing a coherent mental framework out of them. This framework are something [called
   mental models or mental maps. High structure builders learn new material better than low
   structure-builders.
 * Rule learner vs example learner  



## Increase your Abilities
   * Effortful learning changes the brain
   * The path to complex mastery or expert performance does not start from exceptional genes, but it
       certainly entails self-discipline, grit, and persistence;
   * Conscious mnemonic devices can help to organize an cue learning for ready retrieval until
       sustained deliberate practice and repeated use form the deeper encoding and subconscious
       mastery

## Make it stick

### for teachers
Explain how learning works, in particular help student to understand fundamental ideas:

  * Some kinds of difficulties during learning help to make the learning stronger and better
      remembered.
  * When learning is easy, it is often superficial and soon forgotten.
  * Not all of our intellectual abilities are hardwired. In fact, when learning is effortful, it
      changes the brain making new connections and increasing intellectual ability.
  * Your learn better when you wrestle with new problems before being shown the solution, rather
      than the other way around.
  * To achieve excellence in any sphere, you must strive to surpass your current level of ability.
  * Striving by its nature, often results in setbacks, and setbacks are often what provide the
      essential information needed to adjust strategies to achieve mastery.
