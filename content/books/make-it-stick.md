Some random general  highlights
 
  * The most important is to fight forgetfulness.
  * Learning styles is a myth, there are preferences but there is not true that some people learn better with 
    a given kind of material (listening, reading, etc)
  * Recalling and reflection is better than massive practice, the later gives the illusion of knowing by 
    familiarizing the student with the material but the forgetfulness  is quicker



## Learning is misunderstood
when we ask people about the best(preferred) learning method, most people will answer that it would be 
re-reading and highlight  the material, but this  approach is not backed up by data. 

The most effective strategies are often counter intuitive:

  * Retrieval practice 
  * Space out practice
  * Trying to solve a problem before being taught the solution

All new learning requires a foundation of prior learning. If you practice *Elaboration*, there's no known limit
to how much you can learn. **Elaboration** is the process of giving new material meaning by expression it in 
your own words and connecting with what you already know.

## To learn, retrieve
A central Challenge to improving the way we learn is finding a way to interrupt the process of forgetting. 
The testing effect is a term used by psychologist to refer the power observed of retrieval as a learning tool. 


Exams & Testing works, special when we provide feedback on wrong answers

## Mix Up your practice
Most people  think that people learn better through single-minded focus and dogged repetition, because these 
beliefs are validated time and again by visible improvements, but scientists have found that this is momentary.
The very techniques that build habit strength, like spacing, interleaving and variation, slow visible 
acquisition and fail to deliver improvement during practice that helps to motivate and reinforce our efforts 
how ever these techniques are what we need to really learn something 

## Embrace Difficulties
It's one thing to feel confident of your knowledge; it's something else to demonstrate mastery. Testing is not only a powerful learning strategy, it is a potent reality check on accuracy of you own judgment of what you know how to do. 

How learning occurs
 * **Encoding:** the brain  converts your  perceptions into meaningful representations in the brain.
 * **Consolidation:** The process of learning often starts out feeling disorganized and unwieldy; the brain 
     makes connections with prior knowledge by retrieving  a memory from long-term storage. This act both 
     strengthen the memory traces and at the same time make them modifiable again, enabling them, for example, 
     to connect to more recent learning.
  * **Retrieval:** the brain access memories by the "cues" or connections between memories. There is virtually 
     no limit to how much learning we can remember as long as we relate it to what we already know.

When we  make a concentrated effort to recall, the learning is made "editable" again,  and the consequent 
re-consolidation helps to reinforce meaning, strengthen connections to prior knowledge, bolster the cues and 
retrieval routes for recalling it later, and weaken competing routes

In every learning strategy we need to incorporate desirable difficulties, like trying to solve a problem before being show how to solve it.

## Avoid Illusions of knowing
On thinking fast and slow Daniel Kahneman indicates that  our mind has two modes of thinking :  

## Get beyond learning styles

## Make it sticks
