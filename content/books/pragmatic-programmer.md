this is my go to reference book for any software engineering work/life problem. it contains a lot
of wisdom gathered from the tranches of multiple software projects 

Some tips/phrases I remember the most:

* **Mob programming**: when more than two programmers work in the same code, same time. 
* _Take responsibility, provide options , Don't make lame excuses_
* _Stone soup and boiled frogs_ 
* _Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio_
* Good design is easier to change than bad design
* Orthogonality:  in geometry two lines are orthogonal if they meet at right angles. In vector terms
    the two lines are independent. Unfortunately  in Computing science  this term is thought indirectly, 
    decoupling or independent
* Code That Glows in the Dark: tracer bullets projects
* **Keep Knowledge in Plain Text**
* Tip 32 _Read the damn Error Message_
* **Dead programs tell no lies**.  Crash early, do not try to catch every exception
* **Inheritance is Rarely The Answer** it produces coupling, here some alternatives
  * Interfaces and protocols
  * Delegation
  * Mixing and traits
* **Tip 62** Don't program by coincidence. You should program deliberately:
  * Always be aware of what you are doing
  * Can you explain the code, in detail, to a more junior programmer? if not, perhaps you are
      relying on coincidences.
  * Do not code in the dark. Always know what tech or app you are using/building
  * Proceed from a plan, whatever that plan is in your head or napkin or a document.
  * Rely only on reliable things, if you can't tell if something is reliable, assume the worst.
  * Document your assumptions.
  * Don't just test your code, but test you assumptions as well.
  * Prioritize your effort
  * Don't be slave to history
