Principles of service
 1. An absence of fear of the future and of veneration for the past
 2. A disregard of competition. Whoever does a thing best ought to be the ne to do it.
 3. the putting of service before profit. Well-conducted business enterprise cannot fail to return 
    a profit, but profit must and inevitably will come as a reward for good service.
 4. Manufacturing is not buying low and selling high. It is the process of buying materials fairly and, with the smallest possible addition of cost, transforming those materials into a consumable product and giving it to the consumer.
