## Me  in 10 secs
Software engineer, Educator, avid student of life.

## Long version 
I am a life long learner, currently working as software engineer contractor. 

As an Application Developer and Project Manager I have an agile and pragmatic approach to my craft. I have created a wide variety of business applications, with a particular interest in web apps and database design using Java, Go, JavaScript and PostgreSQL. 

Sometime ago I started the Nearsoft Academy, a training program to help recent graduates become world-class software engineers. As their mentor, I try to blend top-of-the-line tech lessons with psychology, persuasion, influence, and economic educational techniques. 

I also want to learn a lot,   lately, besides technical stuff , I have been studying the stoics philosophy
