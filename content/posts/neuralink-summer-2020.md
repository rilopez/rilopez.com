## My takeaways
-  Neuralink had a great streaming showing their latest updates
they showed live telemetry directly from an alive walking pig 
- Pigs are similar to people, they move a lot and they are robust so if the device
 does not get malfunctions on pigs , it would work on people
- Currently the team is 100 people, it is expected to grow up to 10K people  
- the device uses something like  bluetooth 
- Clinical trial is aimed at people with paraplegia
- In the future you can record your memories and play it back, How do we know that 
  this moment is not our future self playing back his memories?.
- Programming lang? Several, for chip prolog, C++, Python, but it is not important any 
  program should work.
- _We are in some way Hydrogen Evolved, and some day along the way hydrogen started talking and thought it was conscious_ -- Elon Musk  
- _If you bombard earth with photos for long enough, it will emit a tesla_ --  Neuralink eng.
