## My takeaways

- Be grateful with what you are
- Do not think on what you do not have, think on what you have.
- Disabled is just in the mind
- Ask for a second opinion when somebody give you a bad opinion
- The day you think you reached your full potential, is the day when you haven't done it.
- Live a life without limits
