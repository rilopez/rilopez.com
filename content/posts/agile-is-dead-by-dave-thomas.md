## My Takeaways

- UML destroyed the OOP by  focusing a generation of programmers into Classes instead of objects.
- Agile is not a noun, it is an adjective
- Fear sells: Â new words, new roles, new ways to measure, are we doing it right?
- Cool sells: bright & Shiny, feeling the power, What!!, you aren't doing Agile!!
- Agile is an industry, that taxes us in terms of fear
- Reclaiming Agility , 3 steps and a loop:

  1. [what to do] Find out where you are
  2. Take small step towards your goal
  3. Adjust you understanding based on what you learned

- No rules are universal, all rules require a context
