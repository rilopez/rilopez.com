I read the book [fearless change]({{< ref "/books/fearless-change.md" >}}) almost 8 years ago and since then I have been a big follower 
of Linda Rising teachings. Because one of my new-year resolutions was to meet at least one of my heros, I asked [Carlos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosponcerobles) 
(from dojo live) to help me talk to Linda Rising, I was not hoping he could get her as a guess in dojo live,.. ohh I was very very wrong.
 
So today was the day I was looking forward all this first months of the year,  I talked to the great Linda Rising.
