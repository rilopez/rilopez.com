I just discovered Marshall goldsmith and he is awesome, looking forward to read his book 
[What got you here, won't get you there]({{< ref "/books/what-got-you-here.md">}}). Here are my takeaways:

* _We spend a lot of time helping leaders learn what to do, we don't spend
        enough time helping leaders learn what to stop_ -Peter Drucker
* WINNING TO MUCH, we are so competitive that we argue who is more miserable
* "help more, judge less"
* Use little amounts of money to produce change  in behavior
* We only can change what we want to change. If you want to change other people that don't want to change, 
  let it go.
* Only do what works for you
* You don't have to know the past of someone to help him
* Developing yourself as a leader and partner: ask, listen think, thank, respond, involve, change, follow-up
* What i can't do to be better?  (parent , partner, team member, son)
* I can't be better in everything I CAN be better in one thing
* Follow-Up its important.
* Be happy NOW,  you are gone to day anyway.
* If you have a dream go for it
* Have fun, life its short.
