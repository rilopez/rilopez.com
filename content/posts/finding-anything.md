some time ago I read [Algorithms to Live By](../books/algorithms-to-live-by.md),

started to put into practice "optimal stopping problem" algorthm,  I "learned" about this algoritm back on my  CS Collage classes


it is useful to decide and commit to a given opportunity, given multiple options and you do know if there are going to be better oportunities in the future

in summary , this is the algorithm
   -  given a set of options
   -  define some kind of quality objective
   -  explore 37% of options
   -  commit in the next best opportunity
