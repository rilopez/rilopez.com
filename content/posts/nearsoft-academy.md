8 years ago I started the fundations of our intership program at nearsoft, called Nearsoft Academy.
So far 91 young engneers has taken the program, most of them worked for us right after graduation. 


## Designing an intership program

Because I think that a software engeener is most about people than about "techy stuff", I tried to
design the program following the teachings several books like [fearless change](/books/fearless-change),
[pragmatic programmer](/books/pragmatic-programmer), [outliers](/books/outliers) & [code
complete](/books/code-complete)

The program was designed around the following goals:
1. Hands-on training
2. Develop talent
3. Help them to gain by themselves a good tech reputation
