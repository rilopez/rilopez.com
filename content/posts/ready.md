title: "When the Student Is Ready, the Mentors Appear"

The saying "when the student is ready, the teacher appears; when the student is truly ready, the teacher disappears" has been a guiding principle in my journey of continuous learning. In this post, I reflect on the mentors who have shaped my path at critical moments.

Multiple times in my life I got the opportunity to find good teachers, 

 - When I needed to learn what a body can do, I found a lima-lama teacher in my neighborhood
 - When I needed to learn music, I found [DiosdadoFuentes] and [AaronJimenez]
 - When I needed to learn what a professional really is, I found [VicenteRomero]
 - When I needed to learn how to lead, I found [HumbertoCurmina]
 - When I needed to learn what team really is, I found [RobertoMartinez]
 - When I needed to learn life I found my daughters

Although I have lost contact with some of my teachers and mentors, their teachings remain with me. Even when I feel unprepared to be without their guidance, their absence instills a confidence that I am truly ready to forge ahead independently.

As I continue on my journey, I am reminded that each mentor has not just taught me something specific but has also prepared me to eventually take those lessons forward on my own. Who have been your mentors, and what lessons have they left with you?
